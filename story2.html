<h1 classname="story2H2">Story2</h1>
		<p  classname="story2P1">	It was a very rainy day, it was fucking pouring, One of those days. Anyways, it was about 11 o'clock... Stewart finaally got home from a shitty day at work, mind you he walked 2 miles home from YaDig Street, (Don't forget ITS POURING) and Stewarts clothes were fuckin soaked. He opened his bedroom door after unchanging and taking a well needed shower... then he remembered.. he left his wallet at work! HAHAHAHA "Fuck that empty wallet" Stewart thought. Unfortunately his liscence was inside it, and he knew the tsunami outside was looking like the much needed route. Stewart thought to himself... "if only I new a way to control tab in real life, I could just open a new tab and forget about all this shit" Just when Stewart was about to step into the outside rain hell, he glanced down and saw the most beautiful substance known to man....</p>

		<p classname="story2P2">He ran quickly to his bedroom dresser top shelf. The immediate excitement and relief going through Stewart's mind was about as insane as his day! He got out everythingt he needed to fix his solution, yet.. like the rest of everything occuring in Stewarts day.. he was OUT of god damn swishers. "Fuck it, the corner stores 30 ft away" Stewart grabbed 4 quarters threw on some flip flops and sprinted out! About 3 minutes later he was back grinding that most beautiful substance- aka POT. Before he knew it he was toking on the gorilla finger he perfectly rolled. And better yet he figured out the control tab method to life- puff puff exhale... and before he knew it Stewart forgot about the rain, his soaked clothes, his practically negative net worth, OH YEAHHH AND HIS WALLET HAHAHAHAHA.... To be continued.....</p>
