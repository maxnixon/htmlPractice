      <p class="storyline"> A teenage girl goes to the doctor for her yearly check up. The doctor discovers a brain tumour and tells her she has at the most three days to live. She doesn't tell anyone and goes straight to her boyfriend's house.</p>

      <p class="storyline"><strong>Guy</strong>:''I would shoot myself"</p>
      
      <p class="storyline">The girl kisses him and stays the night. In the early morning, she takes his gun, knives and anything else he might use to kill himself when he discovers the truth. By the time he wakes up, she's gone. She left him a note on her pillow with hearts all over it. It was a scavenger hunt that would take him two days. The last item on the list was her. After two days, he needs to find her to complete the scavenger hunt. He goes to his house, where he sees a trail of roses leading to his room. He finds her sleeping in his bed already. Next to her, there's a box and a letter that read like this:</p>
    
    
      <div class= "letterBoard"><h1 class="alignLeft"> My Dearest Love,</h1><!add text-align left !>
  
  
      <p class="script">If you have found this, I am already in heaven, looking at you. I sent you on a scavenger hunt so that you wouldn't know I was dying of a brain tumour. I did not want to see you worry nor did I want to be the cause of your death. I left you a little something in the box and I hope you can forgive me for not spending my last waking moments in your arms. I hope u can forgive me and continue on with your life </p>
  
 
    <h2 class="alignCenter">Signed</h2><!make text-align: center!>
    
    
    <h2 class="alignCenter">Your Love 4 ever</h2><!make text-align: center!>
    
    <h1 class="bold">P.S</h1>
    
    <h1 class="bold">I will always love you with all of my heart. Remember, check the box and don't cry over me.</h1>
    
    <p class="bold">I will always love you with all of my heart. Remember, check the box and don't cry over me.</p>
    
    <p class="bold">" I will always love you even from heaven. I hope you make the right choice."</p></div>

    <p class="storyline">He gets the gun and shoots himself just to go see her in heaven and love her again . When he gets to heaven, he sees her standing there and looking at him as he enters through the pearly gates.</p>
    
    <p class="storyline"> Girl:'' I thought you were going to do the right choice baby."</p>
